## Introduction

`ai_cv_builder` is a Python library designed to simplify the creation of personalized, professional resumes. By integrating with GPT models, this library allows you to generate resumes tailored to specific job descriptions and formatted in various styles. It provides a flexible approach to resume building with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Dynamic Resume Styling:** Choose from pre-defined styles to create visually appealing resumes.
- **Job Description Integration:** Customize resumes based on job description URLs.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Set up resume details using YAML configuration files.
- **Interactive CLI:** Easily generate resumes via an interactive command-line interface.
- **AI-Powered Content:** Leverage GPT models to enhance resume content.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamOdum/ai_cv_builder.git
   cd ai_cv_builder
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `secrets.yaml` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:

   ```yaml
   openai_api_key: "your-api-key-here"
   ```

6. Create a `my_resume.yaml` file with your resume details (see documentation for format).

## Usage

To run the resume builder:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

1. Load your API key and resume data
2. Prompt you to choose a resume style
3. Generate a resume based on your data and chosen style
4. Save the output as an HTML file

## Known Issues

### CSS Style Path Setting

There is a known issue with setting the CSS style path in [manager_facade.py](manager_facade.py) when using the package in different environments:

1. When using the package as a module in another project, the following code is used to set the CSS style path:

```python
   def choose_style(self):
        styles = self.style_manager.get_styles()
        if not styles:
            print("No styles available")
            return None
        final_style_choice = "Create your resume style in CSS"
        formatted_choices = self.style_manager.format_choices(styles)
        formatted_choices.append(final_style_choice)
        selected_choice = self.prompt_user(formatted_choices, "Which style would you like to adopt?")
        if selected_choice == final_style_choice:
            tutorial_url = "https://github.com/samodum/ai_cv_builder/blob/main/how_to_contribute/web_designer.md"
            print("\nOpening tutorial in your browser...")
            webbrowser.open(tutorial_url)
            exit()
        else:
            self.selected_style = selected_choice.split(' (')[0]
```

2. However, when running the module locally, the following code is required for the CSS style path to be set correctly:

```python
   def choose_style(self):
      styles = self.style_manager.get_styles()
      if not styles:
         print("No styles available")
         return None
      final_style_choice = "Create your resume style in CSS"
      formatted_choices = self.style_manager.format_choices(styles)
      formatted_choices.append(final_style_choice)
      selected_choice = self.prompt_user(formatted_choices, "Which style would you like to adopt?")
      if selected_choice == final_style_choice:
         tutorial_url = "https://github.com/samodum/ai_cv_builder/blob/main/how_to_contribute/web_designer.md"
         print("\nOpening tutorial in your browser...")
         webbrowser.open(tutorial_url)
         exit()
      else:
         self.selected_style = selected_choice.split(' (')[0]
         full_style_path = self.style_manager.get_style_path(self.selected_style)

         # Create relative path
         self.selected_style_path = '/' + '/'.join(Path(full_style_path).parts[-3:])
```
